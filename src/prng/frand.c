 * IEEE 754 double precision format:
 *   bit 63: sign
 *   bit 62-52: exponent (11 bits)
 *   Bit 51-0:  fraction.
 *
 * So, when we set sign = 0 and exponent = 0xfff, then the format
 * represents a normalized number in the range [1, 2).
 *
 * So, if we can manage to fill the 52 bits with random bits, we
 * will have a normalized random number in the range [1, 2). Then,
 * we subtract 1.0 and voila - we have a random number in the range
 * [0, 1.0).
